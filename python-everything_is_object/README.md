# **Python :snake: - Everything is Object**

## **Learning Objectives**


- **What is an object:**
	EVERYTHING IS OBJECT :smile: Each Object if an instance of a particular class or subclass.
	All individual object possess three basics characteristics: **identity, state and behavior.**
	<ol> <li><strong>Identity</strong> </li> means that each object has its own <u> object identifier</u> and can be differentiated from all the other object. Each identity's is unique.
	<li> <strong> State</strong></li> Refers to the <u> properties </u> of an object. For example, values of variables in the object contain data that can be added, changed, deleted.
	<li><strong> Behavior </strong></li>
	Refers to actions that the object can take. For example, one object can respond to another one, to carry out our software functions.</ol>
