## **Learning Objectives**

- **What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project:**
	A unit test is a test that checks a single component of code, usually modularized as a function, and ensures that it performs as expected. <br>
	Unit tests are an important part of regression testing to ensure that the code **still functions as expected after making changes** to the code and helps ensure **code stability.** After making changes to our code, we can run the unit tests we have created previously to ensure that the existing functionality in other parts of the codebase *has not been impacted by our changes.*

	Another key benefit of unit tests is that they help easily isolate errors. Imagine running the entire project and receiving a string of errors. How would we go about debugging our code?
