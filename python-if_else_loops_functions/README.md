# Team What If ? or Team What Else ?
## (more seriously) Here it's about If/Else statement, loops and functions

### **General**

- **Why Python programming is awesome**
- Why indentation is so important in Python
- **How to use the if, if ... else statements** <br>
	### *If statement*
	Perhaps most well known statement !
	
	```
		number = x
		if x > 0:
			print('Number is positive')
	```
- How to use comments
- How to affect values to variables
- How to use the while and for loops
- How is Python’s for different from C‘s?
- How to use the break and continues statements
- How to use else clauses on loops
- What does the pass statement do, and when to use it
- **How to use <em>range</em>** <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; range() built-in functions comes in handy. It generates arithmetics expressions from a given and end point you can specify, you can also specify the step-size of incrementation (or decrementation):
```
   range(5, 10) ==> 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
   range(0, 10, 3) ==> 0, 3, 6, 9
```

- What does return a function that does not use any return statement
- Scope of variables
- What’s a traceback
- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
