# **Python :snake: - Classes and Objects**

## **Learning Objectives**

- **What is OOP**

	  ***why do we need OOP***
	  - Makes developing large software projects easier and more intuitive
	  - Allows us to think of complex software in terms of real-world objects and <br>
	  their relationship to one another
	  - A very common **programming paradigm (i.e. style of designing a software, specific way we design the software)
	
- **“first-class everything” :**
	I have to tell you something guys: in Python, `everrything is a class`, yes indeed, Sir Guido Van Rossum has designed Python according to the principle written as title: **"first class everything".**
	In other words, he wanted *everything* to be treated the same way, everything is a class implies that functions and methods are values just like lists, integers, characters...Each of these are instances of their corresponding classes.
	Guido wrote:"One of my goals for Python was to make it so that all objects were "first class", by this, I meant that I wanted all objects that could be named in the language (e.g. integers, strings, functions, classes, modules, methods, and so on) to have an equal status. That is, they can be assigned to variables, placed in lists, stored in dictionaries, passed as arguments, an so forth" (Blog, The History of Python, February 27, 2009).

- **What is a class:**
- **What is an object and an instance:**
	An **Object** is an entity, or a "thing" in your program, often a noun.(such as a person, an email)
	**Objects** are like little bundles of data that will be used in the life of our program.
	For example, a person will have *properties* (or "data"), like *Name, Age, Adress*, our object also have *behaviors* , the actions the object can take, like *Walk, Talk, Breathe.*
